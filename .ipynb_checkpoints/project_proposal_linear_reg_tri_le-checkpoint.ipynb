    "# COURSE PROJECT PROPOSAL | EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions/Needs:\n",
    "*What is the framing question behind your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?*\n",
    "* Which MTA stations experience the most traffic during peak morning business hours of 6AM-9AM, MON-FRI?\n",
    "* Which MTA stations experience the least traffic during peak morning business hours of 6AM-9AM, MON-FRI?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?*\n",
    "* A *fictional* business named \"Bagels and Brew\" with considerations to open locations in NYC\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Description:\n",
    "*What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?*\n",
    "* MTA Turnstile Data from the MTA website, retrieved using a Python script \n",
    "\n",
    "*What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project (i.e., what are your rows)? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with (i.e., what are your columns of interest)?*\n",
    " * The rows are turnstile readings (cumulative entry and exit counts) from individual turnstile units, from different stations and linenames of the MTA, which are periodically recorded\n",
    "* Columns of interest include: C/A, UNIT, SCP, STATION, LINENAME, DATE, TIME, ENTIRES, EXITS\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools:\n",
    "*How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?*\n",
    "* Extract raw data into a SQL database and querying from that database into Python via SQLAlchemy\n",
    "* Perform data cleaning and analyses using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy\n",
    "* Data visualization and modeling using Matplotlib and Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "*Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?*\n",
    "* Unsure at this time\n",
    "\n",
    "### MVP Goal:\n",
    "*What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?*\n",
    "* I'll start with a plot of MTA stations with corresponding cumulative traffic with the intent to further breakdown traffic by weekday and day-part\n"
